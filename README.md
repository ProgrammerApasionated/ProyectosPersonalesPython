# 📚 Project Ideas Based on My Personal Python Framework

This document presents a collection of **practical projects** designed to be developed using my **personal Python framework**, which is based on a modular architecture that integrates:

- Interactive console menus  
- Use of lists and data structures  
- Classes and object-oriented programming  
- Input validation  
- Statistical analysis  
- Data persistence using files  

The main goal of these projects is to **solve real-world problems** through robust, scalable, and easily extensible applications, while reinforcing programming logic and software development best practices.

## 1. Personal Expense Analyzer

**Problem**  
Many people lack a clear understanding of how they spend their money and how their expenses are distributed over time, making financial planning difficult.

**Objective**  
Develop an application that allows users to:
- Record daily expenses
- Classify them by category (food, transport, leisure, etc.)
- Calculate statistics such as average, maximum, and minimum expenses
- Obtain category-based percentages
- Save and load data from files

## 2. Product Inventory Manager

**Problem**  
Small businesses or individual users need to manage products, prices, and stock without relying on complex or expensive tools.

**Objective**  
Create an inventory system that:
- Supports full CRUD operations for products
- Manages stock levels and pricing
- Generates automatic reports
- Persists data using files
- Analyzes most expensive, cheapest, or low-stock products

## 3. Academic Grading System

**Problem**  
Students need a simple way to record grades and analyze their academic performance over time.

**Objective**  
Implement a system that allows users to:
- Manage students and subjects
- Record grades
- Calculate averages per student and per subject
- Detect pass/fail streaks
- Obtain academic success percentages

## 4. Advanced Rainfall Analyzer

**Problem**  
Recording rainfall data is straightforward, but analyzing it properly (streaks, maximums, averages, or patterns) is more complex.

**Objective**  
Develop an application that:
- Records daily rainfall data
- Calculates averages, maximums, and minimums
- Detects rainy and dry-day streaks
- Generates complete climate statistics
- Stores data persistently

## 5. Habit and Routine Tracker

**Problem**  
Maintaining healthy or productive habits requires continuous tracking and progress analysis over time.

**Objective**  
Create a system that:
- Defines daily or weekly habits
- Records daily completion
- Calculates consistency streaks
- Computes completion percentages
- Analyzes monthly and overall progress

## 6. Personal Library System

**Problem**  
Readers often accumulate books and lose track of what they have read, what is pending, or what they enjoyed the most.

**Objective**  
Develop a digital library that:
- Manages books, authors, and genres
- Tracks reading status
- Stores personal ratings
- Generates reading statistics
- Saves all data to files

---

## 7. Text Analyzer

**Problem**  
Manually analyzing texts (word frequency, average length, etc.) is slow and error-prone.

**Objective**  
Implement a text analyzer that:
- Loads text files
- Calculates word, sentence, and character counts
- Computes word frequency
- Calculates average word and sentence lengths
- Generates automatic reports

---

## 8. Voting System

**Problem**  
Manual vote counting and percentage calculations can lead to errors and lack of transparency.

**Objective**  
Create a voting system that:
- Registers candidates
- Collects votes in a controlled manner
- Automatically calculates percentages
- Determines the winner
- Saves results to files

---

## 9. Priority-Based Task Manager

**Problem**  
Organizing tasks by priority and status can become chaotic without a clear system.

**Objective**  
Develop a task manager that:
- Creates, edits, and deletes tasks
- Assigns priorities and statuses (pending, in progress, completed)
- Generates productivity statistics
- Analyzes completed and pending tasks
- Persists data using files

---

## 10. Store Simulator

**Problem**  
Understanding the internal logic of a store (products, customers, purchases, and stock) is essential for developing commercial software.

**Objective**  
Create a simulator that:
- Manages products and inventory
- Allows simulated purchases
- Calculates totals and receipts
- Automatically updates stock
- Generates sales statistics
- Saves all information to files
