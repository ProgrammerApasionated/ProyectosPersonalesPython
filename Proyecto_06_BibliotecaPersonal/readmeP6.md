# 📚 Library Management System in Python

Object-oriented Python application that simulates a digital library.  
It allows you to manage books, handle loans and returns, analyze statistics, and persist all data using text files.

This project is part of my personal portfolio of **10 Python applications**, focused on building simple, maintainable, and scalable software that solves real-world problems.
