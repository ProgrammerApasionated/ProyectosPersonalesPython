# 📝 Notes Manager in Python

Modular Python application that allows you to create, view, search, and delete notes from the console.  
It includes interactive menus, input validation, file persistence, and a clear function-based structure.

This project is part of my personal portfolio of **10 Python applications**, focused on building simple, maintainable software aimed at solving real-world problems.
